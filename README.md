# Maneuver-Detection-Using-Machine-Learning
Comprehensive Document (Methodology & Results)
In the document, include the following sections:

Introduction: Define the problem and the goal of maneuver detection.
Data Overview: Describe the dataset, including what features (SMA) and labels (maneuvers) are being used.
Methodology:
Preprocessing: Explain how data was preprocessed (converting dates, calculating SMA change, etc.).
Feature Engineering: Highlight the importance of SMA change as a feature.
Model Selection: Justify the choice of Random Forest (or the chosen algorithm).
Results:
Present the classification report, confusion matrix, and accuracy metrics.
Discuss false positives/negatives.
Conclusion: Summarize findings, potential improvements (e.g., more features or different algorithms), and next steps.
